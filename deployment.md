Describe your development and deployment workflow in enough detail that a
new team member or someone taking over the project could follow to successfully develop theme
updates locally, then test and deploy them to your staging and live sites. This should include aspects
such as project management, version control, testing and automation. Do not provide private details
like passwords.

## Local Development
For each member of the group we installed and used "Local by Flywheel" - a local hosting site that we uploaded a zip file of wordpress to to initialise and start our website. We then started adding content to the website and used a plugin called "All-in-one WP Migration" to export any changes to the staging site. Then each group member exported the staging back in to their local to make any changes and add style code to the theme files.

## Staging Site
We used siteground as a hosting for our staging development site and used a plugin called "All-in-one WP Migration" to allow us to move content between the local and staging. This allowed everyone to see the changes that were made and allowed us to have group meetings on what areas to work on and add to.

## Version Control
We used our Github repositiory for our verison control for our css and php code and used "Visual Studio Code" to allow us to make changes to the css and php files and push the commited updates to Github. We set up the Github repository link in our local development theme folder on each of our computers so that we could see any of the changes in our local site instantly
