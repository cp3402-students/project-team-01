## Local Development
For each member of the group we installed and used "Local by Flywheel" - a local hosting site that we uploaded a zip file of wordpress to to initialise and start our website. We then started adding content to the website and used a plugin called "All-in-one WP Migration" to export any changes to the staging site. Then each group member exported the staging back in to their local to make any changes and add style code to the theme files.

## Staging Site
We used siteground as a hosting for our staging development site and used a plugin called "All-in-one WP Migration" to allow us to move content between the local and staging. This allowed everyone to see the changes that were made and allowed us to have group meetings on what areas to work on and add to. We set up admin logins for each of the group members to allow everyone to freely access and change anything reguarding the site.

## Version Control
We used our Github repositiory for our verison control for our css and php code and used "Visual Studio Code" to allow us to make changes to the css and php files and push the commited updates to Github. We set up the Github repository link in our local development theme folder on each of our computers so that we could see any of the changes in our local site instantly

## Project Management
We outlined and planned our project on "Trello" and assigned tasks to different group members through the Trello workspace. This was used as our main hub for group meetings and standup meetings to evaluate what had been done and tasks that still needed to be completed. We then used our staging site through screen sharing on "Discord" to visually see what had been completed and what ideas we had to add changes for a smoother site design. During each meeting we took notes and made those changes before the next meeting where we discussed new changes and ideas.

## Testing
We used our local development as our main source of testing for both content layout and css style editing.
We used the inspect tab on the web browser of our local site to see the class IDs and tags to certain attrbutes and fields within the site and added in css code to change things like postioning, colour, and margins. We did this testing in the local site using "Visual Studio Code" then once we were happy with the change, we'd commit and push the change to the group repository so that everyone could sync the change to their local sites and continue their testing.
