## Header Customisation
The header allows visitors naviage the website much easier. The simple header has been built deliberately in accordance with the target audience as it is suitable for older generartion so they won't run into issues navigating the site. Simply locate the header.php file in the theme folder and make your changes. Developers have the freedom to alter the header section's format and content due to this file. The logo, site title, motto, and navigation bar are all easily recognisable components of the header. Colour, typefaces, layout, and positioning of components like the logo and navigation bar are all controlled by the style.css file. It also determines the header's basic properties. You may quickly change the header to match your chosen design by finding the relevant classes inside the header section of the stylesheet.

## Footer Customisation

Developers have the freedom to alter the header section's format and content thanks to this file. The menu navigation bar, address and copyright information are all easily recognisable components of the footer.

## Fonts
We have chosen a simple and user-friendly font, Arial, from the sans-serif font family for the colours used in the theme. This font is widely recognized and familiar to users, ensuring a seamless reading experience. However, for the page title, we opted for a more distinctive and captivating font called Pacifico from the Cursive font family. This change adds a unique and visually appealing touch to the title, making it stand out and capturing the attention of visitors.

## Colours
This colour scheme represents the authenticity and simplicity that are fundamental to country music. The usage of white and grey increases the aesthetics of the site overall and makes the content very readable, allowing users to engage with the site's content effortlessly.
