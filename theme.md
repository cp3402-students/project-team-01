This page should help a new developer to continue developing your theme. Include
relevant information about what features your theme has, files that would need editing, design
decisions, colours, etc. You do not need to produce a serious design document or reproduce basic
details about WordPress theme development, only what is specific to your theme


## Theme Features

## Header Customisation

## Footer Customisation

## Fonts
We have chosen a simple and user-friendly font, Arial, from the sans-serif font family for the colors used in the theme. This font is widely recognized and familiar to users, ensuring a seamless reading experience. However, for the page title, we opted for a more distinctive and captivating font called Pacifico from the Cursive font family. This change adds a unique and visually appealing touch to the title, making it stand out and capturing the attention of visitors.
